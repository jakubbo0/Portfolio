## About me

I am a positive-thinking person who is looking for opportunities for development. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

Graduating from a technical college specializing in IT enabled me to obtain professional qualifications INF-02 (“Administration and operation of computer systems, peripheral devices, and local computer networks”) and INF-03 (“Creation and administration of websites and databases”).

Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively learning techniques and tools by participating in online courses and testing web applications designed for educational purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal.
